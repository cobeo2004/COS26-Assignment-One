    <h1>Enhancements</h1>
    <h2><a href="apply.html">First: CSS Heading Typing Animation</a></h2>
    <p>
      The first enhancement uses advanced CSS such as keyframes and animations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The animation is done by placing the page heading into a container, then
      gradually increasing the width of the container to make it look like the
      text is being typed out. For the blinking cursor animation, the right
      border of the container alternates between solid black and transparent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to each heading having different lengths, the CSS must be adapted
      individually to fit each heading.
    </p>
    <p>
      The animation is done using only HTML and CSS, and the keyframes and
      animations go beyond what was taught in the lectures. Overall, the aim of
      this enhancement was to make the website more dynamic and enjoyable to
      use, therefore increasing the quality of the website and making it more
      engaging to users.

    <h2><a href="about.html">Second: CSS Hovering Card Animation</a></h2>
    <p>The second enhancement uses simple hover CSS animation.</p>
    <p>
      The animation is done by adding a hover effect to the group member's card.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the user hovers the group member's card, the card will scale up 20%,
      the background color of the card changes to the purple linear gradient
      color, the member's image will scale 10% up and the text color will
      changes into white. In addition, the 'Contact Us' button will also scale
      up 20% and change its color to purple linear gradient while user hovering
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This animation is done by only using HTML and simple CSS hover attribute.
      The aim of this animation was to make the about page looks more modern and
      ease to use, thus increasing the website's quality and consistency.
